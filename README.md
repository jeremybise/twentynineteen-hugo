# Twenty Nineteen Hugo

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) port of WordPress's [Twenty Nineteen](https://github.com/wordpress/twentynineteen) theme.

## Highlights

- Accent color configurable via config.toml
- Featured images via `image:` in your post or page frontmatter 
- Featured image filter effect works and can be disabled
- Menu locations and social menu icons all work using Hugo's built-in menus
- Syntax highlighting included with the Monokai Light syntax theme
- Image alignment and caption styles ported to work nicely Hugo's built-in [figure shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure)

## Installation

From the root of your site:

`git submodule add https://github.com/jeremybise/twentynineteen-hugo.git themes/twentynineteen-hugo`

In your `config.toml`, add the following:

`theme = "twentynineteen-hugo"`

## Updating

From the root of your site:

`git submodule update --remote --merge`

## Differences from original theme

- Comment stuff has been omitted
- Author stuff has been omitted

## Content Notes

- To set a featured image for a post or page, add `image: /path/to/image.jpg` to your post or page's frontmatter.
- If your article will include a snippet of code, set `has_code: true` to activate syntax highlighting.

## Available Site Params

Some theme features can be configured in `config.toml`. Here are the options:

```toml
[params]
  accent_color = "#FF0000" # Set a custom accent color for links and image filters, if enabled. Defaults to blue.
  description = "This is the site tagline." # Adds tagline next to the site title.
  privacy_link = "/privacy/" # Relative URL to privacy page, if there is one. This enables a Privacy Policy link in the footer. The link doesn't display if this isn't specified.
  disable_image_filters = false # Setting to true disables the color filter feature on images. Defaults to false.
  body_font = "Source Sans Pro" # Customizing the body font
  using_google_fonts = true # Set up this to true if your font is from Google fonts
  code_theme = "solarized-dark" # Setup the syntax highlighting code you want to use if you will use code, defaults to monokai (see available styles here: https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles)
```

## Menus

The theme includes three menu locations: `main`, `social` and `footer`.

You can include pages in the `main` and `footer` menus using any of Hugo's [documented methods](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/).

Sub menus work one level deep. For example, in your frontmatter:

```yaml
menu:
  main:
    parent: "About Hugo"
```

The social menu can be configured in `config.toml` following this example:

```toml
[menu]
  [[menu.social]]
    identifier = "github"
    name = "Github"
    url = "https://github.com/gohugoio"
  [menu]
  [[menu.social]]
    identifier = "twitter"
    name = "Twitter"
    url = "https://twitter.com/gohugoio"
```

The theme uses the `identifier` to determine which icon to show. For a listing of which icons are available, check out the [social icons partial folder](https://github.com/jeremybise/twentynineteen-hugo/tree/master/layouts/partials/icons/social).

## Search

Add the JSON output format to your `config.toml` to create the index:

```toml
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]
```

Add `search.md` at the root of your `content` folder with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Search"
type: static
layout: search
---
```

## Google Analytics

Add your Google Analytics Tracking Code ID to your `config.toml`:

```googleAnalytics = "UA-123-45"```

The asynchronous tracking script will be included on pages on the live server, but not the dev server.
